# Static

Storing static files for projects.

## Usage

Just between you and me.
First, commit the files to the resository.
Then, find the file in the repository and click on it on Github.
There should be a url that looks like this:
`https://github.com/Drblessing/static/blob/main/Images/spring1-cropped.jpeg`
Now we need to get the raw url. To do this, just add ?raw=true to the end of the url.
That should redirect you to the raw file, which looks like this:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drblessing/static/main/Images/spring1-cropped.jpeg`
Now you can use this url in your project.
