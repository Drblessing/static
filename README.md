# Static

This repository is for storing static files such as images, scripts, or stylesheets that are commonly used across several of my projects.

## Usage

Just between you and me...

1. **Commit** the files to the repository.

2. **Find** the file in the repository and click on it on Github. You should see a URL in the address bar that looks like this:

```url
https://github.com/Drblessing/static/blob/main/Images/spring1-cropped.jpeg
```

3. **Get** the raw URL by adding `?raw=true` to the end of the URL. It should look like this:

```url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drblessing/static/main/Images/spring1-cropped.jpeg
```

4.  **Copy** the raw URL and use it in your project.

Remember: treat your repository like a treasured map - keep it organized and easy to navigate.
